# FATALIST

## life's impermanent, and so unpredictable. what would you wanna say to the people who matter to you? 

fatalist is a list making app designed for you to keep your posthumous wishes current - 
recently heartbroken? make sure you get some last words in with your unrequited love!
when friend B is outperforming friend A, make sure the right one gets your TV after you die!
heard a great new song on the radio? make sure people know you need it played at your funeral! 


# core features
* a document view allows you to organize your thinking into sections - funeral details here, what's getting bequeathed to who there, shouts out there. you can combine files together, do version control (will 2.0 etc.) 
* rich text editing with asset insertion allows you to make a document as expressive as you need it to be - maybe this instagram food pic is the perfect complement to your dissatisfaction and fears. 
* html export and other integrations make sure that your thoughts can be shared postmortem through a variety of contemporary channels, from slack (sorry you need to hire another engineer now) to facebook/twitter/instagram to google docs (hey lawyer, turn this into some kind of legal document?) - meaning that you can really write something that probably outlives you.
